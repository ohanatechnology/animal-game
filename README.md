# Animal Game by Daniel Ohana

Animal Game for arc infrastructure coding challenge. Presented as a console application.

# To Do / Improvements

- Create a graphical user interface. I had initially wanted to develop a web / mobile app with a GUI to showcase my design skills. However, with the 2 hour timeframe, I thought there was enough complexity in the challenge for me to keep it simple and console based.
- Improve the method of populating the binary tree with questions / answers.
- Add the ability to enter the correct animal at the end of the game if the guess was wrong, enabling the game to learn.
